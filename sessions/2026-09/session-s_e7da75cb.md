**Claude:**

Good, the path exists. Now checking dispatched/reminded status for each of the 22 "collect" IDs.

**Claude:**

Checked all three action lists per the runbook:

- **dispatch** — empty, nothing to send.
- **collect** — 24 records total; all either already have `reminded.txt` (one reminder already sent, no repeat) or are still under the 24h `dispatched` threshold (the two DR26-09-26 entries, ~13h old). No new reminders needed.
- **deliver** — empty, nothing to wake.
- **close** — out of scope for this robot per the runbook (registry judgment call, not a dispatch task).

No bus messages sent, no files written this cycle — everything is either already handled or not yet due.
